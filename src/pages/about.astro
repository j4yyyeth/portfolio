      <h1>My Journey Into Programming</h1>
      <p>
        My journey started when I became involved in the web 3 space around two
        years ago. Immersing myself within that ecosystem not only showed me how
        incredible blockchain technology is but also how incredible the people
        behind it are. I was eager to build just like them. What started as a
        self-taught journey featuring HTML and CSS quickly evolved into
        something I wanted to take to the next level. So I enrolled in a coding
        bootcamp. The bootcamp was a great experience. Not only did I learn the
        latest and greatest tech, but, more importantly, I solidified my
        programming fundamentals and principles. Since finishing my bootcamp,
        I've been devoting myself to coding every day.

      <h1>Currently</h1>
      <p>
        I have acquired proficiency in several programming languages and
        frameworks, and use those languages on the frontend and backend. Over
        the course of my learning journey, I have successfully conceptualized,
        designed, and executed several diverse projects that showcase my
        practical skills and problem-solving abilities. Additionally, I had the
        opportunity to gain experience through a valuable internship, where I
        contributed to internal and external tools. My passion for coding and my
        dedication to continuous improvement drive me to stay updated with the
        latest industry trends and technologies. I am now actively seeking a
        full-time position where I can apply my skills to contribute effectively
        to a dynamic team and make a meaningful impact.

    <section class="section-four">
      <h1>Onwards</h1>
      <p>
        As I look ahead, I am focused on enhancing my skills within my current
        tech stack even further. The ever-evolving nature of the tech industry
        encourages continuous learning, and I am committed to staying at the
        forefront. In addition to mastering my current skill set, I also plan to
        dive into object-oriented programming languages such as C# and Java.
        These languages offer a powerful and versatile approach to software
        development, and I they would be a great addition to my toolkit.
        Furthermore, I have recently taken an interest in contributing to
        open-source projects. I am drawn to the principles of transparency and
        collaboration that open source embodies. The idea that anyone around the
        world with an internet connection and a computer can contribute to a
        project and drive its success is incredible. I believe that
        participating in open source not only allows me to give back to the
        global tech community but also provides invaluable opportunities for
        skill development and networking. I am excited to continue on with my
        journey, learn, grow, and make an impact.
